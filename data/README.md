The data is separated into 4 categories.

Inside each folder, there are CSV files containing the data and a `solutions.csv` file.

The data files contain two columns: `value` and `weight`. 

**ATTENTION:** the first row contains `optimal solution value` and `knapsack capacity`.

The solution files contain two columns: `number of items in the problem` and `the solution vector`.
